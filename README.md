During the data analytics bootcamp with Le Wagon, and on the 4th week, I delved into the fascinating world of visualizations, creating compelling stories, and extracting insights from data.

I embarked on a mini project about Airbnb with the goal of answering the bussines question:

* Identified and calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as occupancy rate
* Created some insightful charts, each chart highlighted the relevant metrics and visualized trends and patterns
